# Innovate Birmingham Fullstack Developer Capstone Project 

## Overview:
 Walkthrough Assist (WA) provides better orientation for reviewing walkthroughs and offers at-hand curated learning resources. WA is an educational project front and back, designed not just to make learning simpler but also to re-immerse its developers in the course material during its development. Walkthrough Assist’s core features are providing supplemental information alongside course walkthroughs, detailed timestamps for quick reference, must-know concepts in plain language, and additional resources (w3schools, tutorials, MDN Web Docs). 

## Goals :
1. Centralize Existing Assets: WA will offer easy navigation through the course walkthroughs based on content and purpose. WA may allow users to accomplish this through a search feature corresponding to titles with timestamp descriptions or an intuitive selection menu.
 2. Time Specificity: Timestamps with searchable [?] descriptions will be (non-programmatically) generated and provided for quick reference on all video content. 
3. More Context, More Resources: Learning is a different process for everyone. WA will include explanatory resources centered around concepts as needed and resources that offer something for a beginner to an advanced learner. 


## Specifications 
Walkthrough Assist will need access to Innovate Bham videos wherever they are hosted. We’re interested in learning the ins and outs of working with and designing around video content, presumably through embedding.

 Very Tentative Development Milestones
 1. Pulling in and arranging video content within the application, UX, and Backend. 
2. Content writing (timestamps, descriptions, external links), search feature. 
 3. Content writing pt. 2, frontend design and UX design features.Walkthrough Assist aims to maximize the educational value of a student-dev project by combining course review with the development of an education application. Walkthrough Assist (descriptive working title)
